## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Added two new functions (list_countries and random_countries) and made some small additions to some old functions (quick_map and palettes_countries). In addition, the tarball file has been reduced to under 5MB.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* The note is due to some slightly heavy data tables used in the package
