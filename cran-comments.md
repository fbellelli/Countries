## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Addressed errors in the package checks by improving handling of API connection errors


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

* The note is due to some slightly heavy data tables used in the package and non-english characters in country names
