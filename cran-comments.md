## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Small adaptation to accommodate changes in behaviour of *base::is.atomic(NULL)*, which will return FALSE


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* The note is due to some slightly heavy data tables used in the package
