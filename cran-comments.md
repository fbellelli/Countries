## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Fixed invalid URLs. Sorry for missing them.
* Eliminated references to unexported objects, such as foo:::example, in documentation. This was done by exporting one of these functions and removing Rd file for the others


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
